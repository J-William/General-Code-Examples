Homework Assignment #2

James Seymour
Student ID: 1******

Summary:

	Submission for HW2 assignment. Submission demonstrates solutions to the HW assignment by creating a randomly sized linked list of random integer values. Then returns the count of elements(Question #1) and the average of the elements(Question #2). The program then asks the user to choose a new value to insert after nth element(Question #4) and displays the altered list. Finally the program asks the user to choose an element to delete from the list(Question #5) and displays the altered list. 

	(Question #3) Computing times for the counting and averaging algorithms are both O(n). The computational time increases linearly with the size of the data set, as the only significant work of the algorithm is stepping through the list and summing it's values.
